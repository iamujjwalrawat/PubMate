# PubMate
Pub Mate is a Java project designed to function as a counter manager for a pub. The purpose of this project is to allow users to select food and drinks from a menu and customize their order by choosing the size of their drinks and food. The system will keep track of the selected items and display the total cost to the user. When the user is ready to check out, they can generate a bill that will display the final cost of their order.

The project will require the development of a user interface that will display the menu items and allow users to select and customize their order. The system will also need to store the selected items and calculate the total cost of the order. When the user is ready to check out, the system will generate a bill that will display the final cost of the order.

Overall, Pub Mate will provide an easy-to-use and convenient way for users to order food and drinks at a pub and keep track of their expenses.
